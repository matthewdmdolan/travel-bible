This repo aims to make tracking my own travels, both past and future, a lot easier. Also, people are commonly asking recommendations and it makes an easy method for suggesting destinations. 

Ultimately, the repo ingests two google sheet files into sqlite tables. 

An api call is made to gain up to date information on each country, using the https://restcountries.com/ API. 

Finally, the solution is visualised using Tableau.
